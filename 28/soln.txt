The solution for the problem involves matching every character of needle to that in haystack.
we find length of both strings, n and m resp
then we start a for loop on with boundry condition of equal to n-m
we keep a int initiated at zero at start of every loop 
in second loop we have two conditions to test to keep loop going
first condition is - j is less then length of needle 
second condition is - we test every char of haystack at i+j with needle at j, 
if both are true, we increase j by one and so on till it can be done
at end if j is equal to lenght of needle, then index is set to i and we break loop
